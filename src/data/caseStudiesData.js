    description: 'A comprehensive digital experience platform modernisation project that transformed legacy systems into a modern, scalable architecture.',
    fullContent: `
      <h2>Client Context</h2>
      <p>A major Australian public sector organisation was operating on a legacy digital experience platform that was struggling to meet modern citizen expectations. The existing system was built on outdated technology, lacked mobile responsiveness, and couldn't scale to handle increasing traffic during peak periods. The organisation needed a modern, secure, and scalable solution that would improve citizen engagement while maintaining strict compliance and security requirements.</p>
      
      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      <p>The legacy platform presented several critical challenges:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Performance Issues:</strong> Slow page load times and frequent downtime during high-traffic periods</li>
        <li><strong>Security Concerns:</strong> Outdated security protocols that didn't meet current government standards</li>
        <li><strong>Limited Scalability:</strong> Infrastructure couldn't handle traffic spikes during public announcements or service launches</li>
        <li><strong>Poor User Experience:</strong> Non-responsive design and outdated interface that didn't meet modern accessibility standards</li>
        <li><strong>High Maintenance Costs:</strong> Expensive ongoing maintenance of legacy systems</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Aaitek's Approach</h2>
      <p>We conducted a comprehensive assessment of the existing platform and developed a phased modernisation strategy:</p>
      
      <h3>Phase 1: Discovery & Planning</h3>
      <p>We performed a thorough audit of the existing system, identifying all dependencies, integrations, and content migration requirements. This included stakeholder interviews, user journey mapping, and technical architecture analysis.</p>
      
      <h3>Phase 2: Architecture Design</h3>
      <p>We designed a modern, cloud-native architecture using a headless DXP approach. This provided flexibility, scalability, and the ability to integrate with existing government systems while maintaining security and compliance.</p>
      
      <h3>Phase 3: Implementation</h3>
      <p>We implemented the new platform using a microservices architecture, ensuring zero downtime during the migration. Content was migrated systematically, and all integrations were tested thoroughly before going live.</p>
      
      <h3>Phase 4: Launch & Optimisation</h3>
      <p>The new platform was launched with comprehensive monitoring and support. We implemented continuous performance optimisation and provided training for the internal team.</p>
      
      <h2>Technology & Architecture</h2>
      <p>The solution leveraged:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Headless DXP:</strong> Modern content management with API-first architecture</li>
        <li><strong>Cloud Infrastructure:</strong> AWS-based scalable infrastructure with auto-scaling capabilities</li>
        <li><strong>CDN & Caching:</strong> Global content delivery network for optimal performance</li>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> Multi-layer security including WAF, DDoS protection, and compliance with government security standards</li>
        <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Real-time monitoring and alerting for proactive issue resolution</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Outcomes & Impact</h2>
      <p>The modernisation project delivered significant measurable results:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>300% Performance Improvement:</strong> Page load times reduced from 8 seconds to under 2 seconds</li>
        <li><strong>40% Cost Reduction:</strong> Lower infrastructure and maintenance costs through cloud optimisation</li>
        <li><strong>95% User Satisfaction:</strong> Significant improvement in citizen feedback and engagement metrics</li>
        <li><strong>99.9% Uptime:</strong> Reliable service availability even during peak traffic periods</li>
        <li><strong>Enhanced Security:</strong> Achieved compliance with all government security standards</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
      <p>Key insights from this project:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Phased migration approach minimised risk and allowed for continuous stakeholder feedback</li>
        <li>Headless architecture provided the flexibility needed for future integrations and enhancements</li>

    fullContent: `
      <h2>Client Context</h2>
      <p>A major Australian media organisation was operating a high-traffic digital platform that served millions of users daily. The platform was running on on-premises infrastructure that was reaching capacity limits and struggling to handle traffic spikes during breaking news events. The organisation needed to migrate to the cloud to improve scalability, reduce costs, and enhance reliability.</p>
      
      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      <p>The migration presented several significant challenges:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Zero Downtime Requirement:</strong> The platform needed to remain operational throughout the migration</li>
        <li><strong>Traffic Spikes:</strong> The platform experienced unpredictable traffic spikes during breaking news events</li>
        <li><strong>Data Migration:</strong> Large volumes of content, user data, and media files needed to be migrated securely</li>
        <li><strong>Performance Requirements:</strong> The new platform needed to maintain or improve current performance levels</li>
        <li><strong>Cost Optimisation:</strong> Migration needed to reduce infrastructure costs while improving capabilities</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Aaitek's Approach</h2>
      <p>We developed a comprehensive cloud migration strategy with a focus on zero downtime and scalability:</p>
      
      <h3>Assessment & Planning</h3>
      <p>We conducted a thorough assessment of the existing infrastructure, identifying all dependencies, data flows, and performance requirements. This included load testing to understand traffic patterns and peak capacity needs.</p>
      
      <h3>Architecture Design</h3>
      <p>We designed a cloud-native architecture using microservices and containerisation. This provided the scalability needed for traffic spikes while maintaining cost efficiency during normal operations.</p>
      
      <h3>Phased Migration</h3>
      <p>We executed a carefully planned phased migration:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Phase 1:</strong> Non-critical services and static content</li>
        <li><strong>Phase 2:</strong> Application services with blue-green deployment</li>
        <li><strong>Phase 3:</strong> Database migration with replication and failover</li>
        <li><strong>Phase 4:</strong> Media assets and CDN configuration</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Testing & Validation</h3>
      <p>Each phase included comprehensive testing, including load testing, security testing, and failover testing to ensure reliability.</p>
      
      <h2>Technology & Architecture</h2>
      <p>The cloud solution leveraged:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cloud Platform:</strong> AWS with multi-region deployment for redundancy</li>
